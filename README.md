# CodeAlpha_Iris_Flower_Classification
## Project Overview
Classifying flowers based on their characteristics is essential in botany and agriculture. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that classifies Iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.
The classification is based on four key features:

•	Sepal Length

•	Sepal Width

•	Petal Length

•	Petal Width

A reliable classification model can assist botanists, researchers, and horticulturists in accurately identifying flower species, making it useful for ecological research and conservation efforts.
## Dataset Overview
•	Records: 150

•	Variables: 6 (4 features + target variable)

•	Classes: 3 (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

•	Purpose: To classify flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements.
